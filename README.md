# work-day-scheduler

## Client Ask 

AS AN employee with a busy schedule

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## What Was Done

The user is provided with a scheduler that has a separate text area for each hour of the work day

The text areas are color coded based off the time of the day (gray if task's timeslot is in the past, red if it is in the current hour, green if the timeslot is in the future)

The user is given the option to save the task or not. The saved tasks are saved to local storage

If the user clicks the "Clear Unsaved Tasks" button then the page is refreshed and all the unsaved tasks are removed

If the user clicks the "Clear All Tasks" button then the page is refreshed and all tasks are removed
